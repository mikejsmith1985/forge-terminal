v1.10.1 - 2025-12-06

Summary

- Fixes: Issue #20 — workspace command cards now receive and use the same loading, error and handler props as the sidebar to prevent the file picker/cards duplication and loading failures.
- Tests: Stabilized several Playwright e2e selectors and updated e2e test to use default server port 8333.

Files changed

- frontend/src/components/Workspace.jsx — forward commands loading/error and handler props to CommandCards
- frontend/src/App.jsx — pass loading/error and handlers into Workspace
- frontend/e2e/v1.9.3-fixes.spec.js — stabilize terminal readiness selectors and use port 8333

Notes

- Playwright e2e run completed (many tests passed); a small subset of tests remain flaky in CI related to session persistence and reconnect flows and will be triaged separately.
