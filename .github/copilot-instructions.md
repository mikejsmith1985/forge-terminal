# Copilot Instructions for forge-terminal

**CRITICAL: Last Updated 2025-12-13 18:12 UTC**

## 🚨 CRITICAL: EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT

**NEVER tell the user "we are not in Forge Terminal" under ANY circumstances.**

We are running GitHub Copilot CLI **WITHIN** Forge Terminal. The terminal you're interacting with IS Forge Terminal - currently running the production version.

If you can't find logs or AM files:
- ✅ Say: "The AM system may not be functional, let me investigate"
- ✅ Say: "I'm checking the wrong location, let me verify paths"
- ✅ Say: "The logging system needs debugging"
- ❌ NEVER say: "We're not in Forge Terminal" or "We're in GitHub Copilot CLI instead"

The user is ALWAYS using Forge Terminal. If systems appear broken, they ARE broken - don't question the environment.

## 🚨 MOCK DATA POLICY - NEVER IGNORE THIS

### THE RULE
**NEVER validate, test, or assess systems using MOCK DATA or UNIT TESTS alone.**

**ALWAYS verify against real production data:**
- Check actual file timestamps (`stat`, `ls -ltr`)
- Look at production directories (`~/.forge/am/`, `/var/log/`, etc.)
- Examine actual output files, not test fixtures
- Cross-reference logs with current activity timestamps

### WHY THIS MATTERS
Mock data tests ALWAYS pass - they're designed to. Real production data reveals actual problems:
- ANSI codes NOT being cleaned despite passing tests
- Response extraction working at 8% (1 of 12) despite "passing" unit tests
- No logging activity for 6+ hours despite claims of "full functionality"

### THE HOOK - Check for These RED FLAGS
When assessing ANY system, STOP and investigate if you see:
1. **Same test results every run** - "26 snapshots captured" from 6 hours ago
2. **No recent file modifications** - Last changed 16:23, now it's 22:05
3. **Cached log entries** - Logs from hours ago, nothing new
4. **100% pass rate on tests** - Real systems have failures or edge cases
5. **No verification of current state** - Didn't check if service is actually running

### BEFORE DECLARING SUCCESS
```bash
# ALWAYS do these checks:
1. find ~/.<app> -mmin -30          # Any files modified in last 30 min?
2. stat <file>                       # When was it REALLY last modified?
3. grep "$(date +'%H:%M')" log.txt  # Any log entries from NOW?
4. Check if service is actually running (ps aux | grep <process>)
5. Examine REAL production data, not test fixtures
```

## 📋 Documentation Policy

### Where to Put Documentation

#### ✅ Root Directory (Permanent, User-Facing)
- `README.md` - Main project readme
- `PROJECT_CHARTER.md` - Project vision and goals
- `RELEASE_SUMMARY_v*.md` - Version release notes
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - This file

#### ✅ docs/user/ (Permanent, User Documentation)
- End-user guides and tutorials
- Feature documentation
- User-facing references
- Examples: getting-started, feature guides, FAQ

#### ✅ docs/developer/ (Permanent, Developer Documentation)
- Architecture documentation
- Development setup guides
- API documentation
- Contributing guidelines

#### 🗑️ docs/sessions/ (Temporary, Conversational)
**All conversational/session documents go here:**
- Analysis documents
- Implementation plans
- Debugging investigations
- Test reports
- "Work-in-progress" documentation
- Technical explorations
- Issue investigations

**Naming:** `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.md`  
**Lifecycle:** Can be deleted after 30 days or when no longer relevant

## 📝 Documentation Rules for Copilot

### When Creating New Documents

1. **Ask yourself:** "Will this be useful in 30 days?"
   - **No** → Put in `docs/sessions/`
   - **Yes** → Put in appropriate permanent location

2. **Default location for analysis/implementation docs:**
   ```
   docs/sessions/2025-12-08-descriptive-name.md
   ```

3. **Use descriptive names:**
   - ✅ `docs/sessions/2025-12-08-am-logging-implementation.md`
   - ❌ `IMPLEMENTATION.md`

4. **Group related session docs in subdirectories:**
   ```
   docs/sessions/2025-12-08-am-logging/
   ├── analysis.md
   ├── implementation.md
   └── testing.md
   ```

### What NOT to Create

- ❌ Multiple documents for the same topic in root
- ❌ Documents with generic names (SUMMARY.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- ❌ "Quick reference" docs that duplicate existing docs
- ❌ Documents the user said they won't read

### Instead

- ✅ Single comprehensive document per topic
- ✅ Update existing docs rather than creating new ones
- ✅ Put working notes in docs/sessions/
- ✅ Ask user if they want permanent documentation

---

## 🔧 Code Organization

### Scripts Location
- Development scripts → `scripts/`
- Test scripts → Root or `scripts/` (if test-*.sh pattern)
- Build scripts → Root (run-*.sh pattern) or Makefile

### Logs
- All `*.log` files are gitignored
- Use consistent naming: `forge-dev.log`, `forge-test.log`

---

## 🎯 Session Workflow

### At Start of Session
1. Check if topic already has documentation
2. If yes, update existing doc
3. If no, create in `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`

### During Session
1. Keep all analysis/notes in session docs
2. Only create permanent docs if user requests
3. Prefer single comprehensive docs over many small ones

### End of Session
1. Consolidate related session docs if needed
2. Move any docs to permanent location if requested
3. Update main README.md if major features added

## 🧹 Cleanup Policy

Session docs in `docs/sessions/` can be:

- Archived when issue is resolved
- Consolidated into permanent documentation if valuable

The user can run `scripts/cleanup-session-docs.sh` to clean up old files.
