# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Feature Removed in v2.2.8

**This documentation is kept for historical reference only.**

The Forge Assistant feature was removed in version 2.2.8 due to:
- Low usage (Dev Mode only feature)
- Maintenance overhead
- Complexity not justified by user adoption

## What Was Removed

- AI chat interface
- Ollama integration
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) engine
- Vector embeddings and semantic search
- Model training functionality
- Agent mode

## What Remains Active

The following production features continue to work:
- ✅ AM (Artificial Memory) logging system for LLM conversation tracking
- ✅ Vision parser for terminal overlays (error detection, JSON formatting)
- ✅ LLM detector for identifying AI CLI tools (Copilot, Claude, Aider)
- ✅ All terminal functionality
- ✅ Command cards
- ✅ Auto-respond feature

## What We Accomplished

### Phase 1: Knowledge Base Enhancement (COMPLETE ✅)

**Improved from 66.7% → 75% accuracy** by updating `internal/assistant/knowledge.go`:

| q1   | 100%   | 100%  | AM Logging | ✅ Already working |
| q2   | 75%    | 100%  | Tab Shortcuts | ✅ Added Shift+Tab, Alt+Tab |
| q3   | 50%    | 100%  | Vision Detection | ✅ Added image/camera keywords |
| q4   | 75%    | 75%   | WSL Integration | ⚠️ Needs more config details |
| q5   | 100%   | 100%  | Deployment | ✅ Already working |
| q6   | 60%    | 60%   | Themes | ⚠️ Needs color/font specifics |
| q7   | 80%    | 80%   | Command Cards | ✅ Mostly working |
| q8   | 40%    | 100%  | Troubleshooting | ✅ Added connection issues section |
| q9   | 40%    | 100%  | Assistant | ✅ Added full assistant documentation |
| q10  | 80%    | 80%   | API | ✅ Mostly working |
| q11  | 100%   | 100%  | Session Persistence | ✅ Already working |
| q12  | 60%    | 60%   | Terminal Search | ⚠️ Response structure issue |

**Results:** 8/12 → 9/12 passing tests (+1 additional)

### Phase 2: RAG Infrastructure (FRAMEWORK READY 🚀)

All components built and tested:
- ✅ **EmbeddingsClient** - Ollama integration for vector embeddings
- ✅ **VectorStore** - In-memory vector database for semantic search
- ✅ **Indexer** - Document processor with intelligent chunking
- ✅ **RAGEngine** - Full retrieval + generation orchestration

Test scripts created:
- ✅ `scripts/test-rag-phase2.sh` - RAG testing framework
- ✅ `scripts/init-rag.sh` - Initialize vector store with docs
- ✅ `scripts/test-rag-with-embeddings.sh` - Embeddings validation

### Phase 3: Fine-tuning (DESIGNED 🎯)

Strategy documented for training custom Ollama model:
1. Collect training data from Phase 2 results
2. Fine-tune with ollama create
3. Deploy custom model
4. Target: 95%+ accuracy

---

## Architecture

### Phase 1: System Prompt Only
```
Question → Ollama → System Prompt + KB → Response
                    (fixed, ~4000 chars)
```

### Phase 2: RAG-Enhanced
```
Question → Embeddings → Vector Search → Top 5 Docs
                              ↓
         System Prompt + KB + Retrieved Context → Response
                        (dynamic, 8000+ chars)
```

### Phase 3: Fine-Tuned Model
```
Question → Custom Ollama Model (fine-tuned on Forge data)
         → Enhanced Response with Forge expertise
```

## FAQ

**Q: Why only 75% accuracy, not higher?**  
A: System prompt limited to ~4000 characters. RAG (Phase 2) will inject up to 8000+ characters of relevant context, improving accuracy to 85-90%.

**Q: Do I need to retrain the model for Phase 1?**  
A: No! Knowledge base updates have immediate effect. Just restart Forge to load the updated prompt.

**Q: What happens to Phase 3 if Phase 2 doesn't improve?**  
A: If RAG doesn't improve accuracy, debug RAG configuration first, then proceed to fine-tuning with training data.

**Q: Can I run these tests without Ollama?**  
A: Yes for Phase 1 (system prompt only). Phase 2 needs Ollama for embeddings. Phase 3 needs Ollama for fine-tuning.

**Q: How often should I run these tests?**  
A: Run after any knowledge base updates (Phase 1), after RAG changes (Phase 2), or after model updates (Phase 3).
