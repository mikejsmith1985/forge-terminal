Q1: How do I enable session logging in Forge?
Response:
 To enable session logging in Forge Terminal, you can utilize the built-in feature called AM (Artificial Memory) Logging. Here's how to activate it:

1. Open Forge Terminal if it isn't already running.
2. Click on the gear icon located at the bottom left corner of the terminal window to open the settings panel.
3. In the settings panel, navigate to the "General" tab.
4. Find the "AM (Artificial Memory) Logging" section and toggle the switch to the ON position.
5. By default, Forge Terminal saves session logs in the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ForgeTerminal\logs` directory on Windows or `~/.forge/logs` in your home directory on Linux. If you wish to change the log directory, navigate to the "Logging" tab in settings and adjust the "Log Directory" setting accordingly.

Once AM Logging is enabled, Forge Terminal will save a text file of each session along with screenshots (if visual pattern detection is also enabled). The logs are persistent and will be restored on restart. You can access them by navigating to the log directory mentioned earlier.
